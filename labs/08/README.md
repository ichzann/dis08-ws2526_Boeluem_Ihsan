# Data Science Packages

Note

In this exercise, you will practice applying descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to a real-world dataset. The goal is to strengthen your understanding of the methods learned today and prepare for upcoming assignments on hypothesis testing and machine learning.

You may select a dataset from the options below (at least one is required). Consider reusing the same dataset for later assignments to build continuity in your analysis. The UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository is an excellent resource for additional datasets if you’d like to explore further.
Suggested Datasets

Palmer Penguins: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository | R package | CSV export
Wine Quality Dataset: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
Adult Income Dataset: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
Heart Disease Dataset: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
Car Evaluation Dataset: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
Important

Please implement your solutions in a Jupyter notebook called analysis.ipynb and commit it to your repository.
